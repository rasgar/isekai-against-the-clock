## Keep Those Folks Away From Me
Afternoon on a clear, sunny day in Erranthemar, the capital city of [[Locations/Seleneas\|Seleneas]]. [[Characters/Seleneas/Razia Celestia\|Razia Celestia]] is on her way to the castle gardens for some meditation. Alas, someone is waiting there for her who has clearly been looking for her -  her peace and solitude will have to wait.

Razia can't be bothered to remember who this person is at the moment, but it is [[Characters/Seleneas/Minor Seleneans\|Eluniore]], a maid in the employ of the royal family. Months ago, she was selected by the Queen herself to be Razia's personal handmaiden. And she is here today to bring Razia a summons from the King and Queen.
