Cepriso (seh-PREE-soh) is possibly the largest and most prosperous country in Ritravis. Situated right in the center of the landmass, it is a place frequented by travelers. Many pass through on there way to other lands. Just as many choose it as their destination. Its gentle rolling hills are welcoming to all, especially when compared to the harsher terrain of some of the surrounding nations.

The cities of Cepriso have thriving marketplaces and other businesses, offering nearly any service imaginable. Of course, for certain specialties - such as treasures from the ocean, or the unique steam-based technology of [[Locations/Alamaste\|Alamaste]] - travelers will need to venture out to the ends of the continent. But the variety of its offerings offsets that problem for the most part. It remains a hub of travel and trade for folks of all kinds.

Of particular interest to adventurers are its informational archives. It is said that if you need to locate a lost hoard, track a ferocious beast, or answer an obscure riddle, then Cepriso has a tome in a library somewhere that will point you in the right direction.
