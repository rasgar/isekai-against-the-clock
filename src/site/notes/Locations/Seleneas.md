**Seleneas** (suh-LEH-nee-us) is an elven kingdom situated on a large island. Much of their livelihood comes from the sea. As a result, its people have come to worship the moon and the stars, as they are integral to the Selenean way of life. They look to the stars for navigation on voyages, and they look to the moon for the bounty of the tide.

Seleneans sometimes manifest magic, and if they do, it is usually in the form of either star magic or moon magic. They can channel a fraction of this power to emit cosmic light and energy, but nothing so grand as calling magic down from the celestial bodies themselves.

They maintain positive relationships with the countries across the sea, as their lives often depend on it. However, they seem to have grown more independent and prosperous as of late. Any elven citizen asked for details is likely to say, with a knowing smirk, "The Celestial Twins have blessed us with a tremendous bounty."
