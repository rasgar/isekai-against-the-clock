Brugatiel (BROO-guh-teel) is a large kingdom, most of which is situated on forested land. Over the course of many years, it has gradually expanded its borders simply by virtue of its citizens building more and more homes. As these lands are usually home to wild and dangerous beasts, Brugatielans tend to be well-prepared for self defense.

Many disparate peoples have come to call this place home. As a result, there is little to point to for common cultural touchstones. It is more of a collective of small settlements than a unified nation. There is no apparent majority race or language. Nevertheless, those of different settlements are often agreeable, and likely to work with neighboring strangers to keep their homes safe.

Presiding over this wild hodgepodge civilization is a gregarious half-giant king. With his tendency to let the citizens do as they please, he is not what one might expect of a king - but he is perhaps perfectly suited to managing the disorganized mess that is Brugatiel.
