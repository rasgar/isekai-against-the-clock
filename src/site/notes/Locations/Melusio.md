The nation of **Melusio** looks quite small in comparison to its neighbors. This is because the majority of it lies beyond the shore, beneath the waves. What facilities exist on the land help to maintain trade and good relations with the primarily land-based civilizations nearby. And there exist a fair few Melusians who enjoy the opportunity to mingle with such species.

The population consists of a variety of aquatic races, undines being the most common. They are a peaceful people on the whole. Trade with them can be quite valuable to other nations, as they are in a unique position to easily acquire resources from the bottom ocean. However, there are many Melusians who wish to keep to themselves, rather than get involved in the strife of the land-dwellers. It is a stance often debated within Melusio, and well known to Queen Yael. Nevertheless, she believes wholeheartedly in keeping their borders open.

Or at least, she did, before a certain incident occurred.
