**Fabergar** (FAY-ber-GAR, hard "g") is a territory that covers a wide area, but contains comparatively little civilization. It is made up of multiple small settlements which are mostly self-sufficient. It can be a hard life, living off the swampy lands, but the industrious Fabergans make it work.

It seems to be populated mostly with humans. However, the caves of Fabergar are the dwellings of dwarven society. Rarely do the dwarves and humans interact despite being fellows, which explains why most visible settlements have nothing much sturdier than mud and reed huts. They hold no animosity towards each other, but it tends to be the Fabergan way to keep to themselves.

Alas, this way of life was shattered nearly a year ago when Fabergar came under violent attack. Many believe the lone attacker to have been a minion of the Dark Lord, but the truth remains a matter of debate.

## Notable Locations
**Thnekarbo**
The capital city of Fabergar. As the home of [[Characters/Fabergar/Mundryd Jones\|Mundryd Jones]] and the center of his efforts, it is the place that most strongly embodies the divergence from traditional Fabergan architecture. As a result, the streets are always filled with builders and loud noise. It is also the home of burgeoning new businesses, like the boutique Swag Rags or the eatery McJones. Mundryd promises that other cities will have their own local branches "soon".
