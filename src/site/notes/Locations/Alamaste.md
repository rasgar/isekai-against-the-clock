In the desert country of **Alamaste** (ah-lah-MAH-sta), life can be harsh. With the oases that dot the vast sands being key for survival, they became the sites of Alamaste's major cities. This meant that these settlements were far apart from each other, and traveling between them could only be done at the risk of their lives.

But generations ago, their technology began to improve at a rapid pace. Whether it was mysterious sorcery or some kind of secret knowledge, the once-struggling country began boasting structures and devices that had never been seen before. Brave travelers from other nations ventured to their cities - but none left with any better understanding of how Alamaste achieved such prosperity.

What they did learn was that the country was guided to its success by a mysterious individual called the Archon.

## Notable Locations
**Dodgestone**
The capital city of Alamaste, and historically the home of both the Archon and the Marshal. It is the heart of the desert country's mysterious technology. In spite of the strong lawman presence, it's got just as many troublemakers as any part of the Alamastan frontier. A lot of them hang out in rough saloons like the Tungsten Stallion.
