## Profile
Sid Storm is the Champion of [[Locations/Melusio\|Melusio]]. He is a sharp contrast to his "countrymen", what with his four arms and his fiery appearance. Trouble seems to start wherever he goes. It is almost definitely all his fault.

## Fun Facts
- His clothing is conveniently fire resistant. Especially his headband.
- When he first introduced himself in Melusio, he said, "Sid. Storm." His correction was interpreted by the citizens as being his last name.
