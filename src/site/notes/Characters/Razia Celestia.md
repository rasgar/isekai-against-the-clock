## Profile
**Razia** (RAH-zee-uh) is the Champion of [[Locations/Seleneas\|Seleneas]]. Rumored to have divine connections, her fathomless powers give her command over the skies. This has granted her great wealth and status. All of this seems to have gone to her head, making her incredibly arrogant... or maybe she was always that way. She travels with [[Characters/Taegen\|Taegen]], the prince of Seleneas.

In her previous life, she was a quiet college student who loved to watch the stars. It seems now she has everything she ever wanted - aside from the new burden of having to deal with other people so frequently.
