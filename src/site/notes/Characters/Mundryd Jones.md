## Profile
**Mundryd Jones** is the Champion of [[Locations/Fabergar\|Fabergar]]. Around the time that he showed himself and became revered by the citizens, so too did an eccentric hero calling himself Mysterious Orange. No one has ever seen the two men in the same place. He is often seen in the company of his faithful and trusted ally, [[Characters/Dale Diesel\|Dale Diesel]].

## Fun Facts
- His voluminous hair does not fit properly into a hat or helmet. Mysterious Orange seems to have the exact same problem.
- His general philosophy about combat is that if it isn't flashy, it isn't worth the effort.
