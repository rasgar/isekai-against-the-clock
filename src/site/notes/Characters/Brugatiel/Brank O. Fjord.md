## Profile
**Brank O. Fjord** (Brank rhymes with honk) is a well-mannered gentleman who has pledged his services to [[Characters/Brugatiel/Rodrique Khil\|Rodrique Khil]]. No one can really say where he came from, or any details about the supposedly storied lineage of the Fjords - but then again, [[Locations/Brugatiel\|Brugatiel]] is a place where people don't ask questions.

## Fun Facts
- His suit is top quality and looks very expensive, so he clearly comes from money.
- Cruel, baseless insults towards Rod - such as "rabid animal" or "scavenger" - will not be tolerated.
