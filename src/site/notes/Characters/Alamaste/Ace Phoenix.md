## Profile
**Ace Phoenix** is the Champion of [[Locations/Alamaste\|Alamaste]], perhaps better known as their Archon. He is a rough-and-tumble cowboy that is usually astride the strange machine he uses for transportation. This machine, which he refers to as [[Characters/Alamaste/En Jean\|Jean]], is able to carry conversations with him.

## Fun Facts
- Ace always seems to have a long piece of straw sticking out of his teeth.
- Despite his demonic appearance, he does not seem to be a minion of the Dark Lord.
