**En Jean**, better known as Jean, is the steadfast protector of [[Locations/Alamaste\|Alamaste]] and its Champion, [[Characters/Alamaste/Ace Phoenix\|Ace Phoenix]]. He is some manner of biomechanical creature, the likes of which has never been seen elsewhere in [[Locations/Ritravis\|Ritravis]]. His loyalty is constantly put to the test by his difficult charge.

## Fun Facts
It is rumored that Jean was built by an Alamastian a long time ago, but no one has the details.
