## Profile
**Taegen Estellia** (TAY-gen, with a hard "g") is the prince of [[Locations/Seleneas\|Seleneas]]. In spite of his youth, he is a dutiful and loyal man who is shaping up to be a fine future ruler. He has frequently been in a sour mood ever since the arrival of [[Characters/Seleneas/Razia Celestia\|Razia]].

## Fun Facts
- His favorite food is peaches, which sadly don't grow anywhere on Seleneas.
- He braids his hair before going to bed, to keep it from getting tangled up. It's a strategy he learned from a handmaiden when he was a child.
