## Profile
**Dale Diesel** is a citizen of [[Locations/Fabergar\|Fabergar]]. He has contributed greatly to bridging the gap between human and dwarf societies within the country. Strangely, no one remembers seeing him prior to the arrival of [[Characters/Fabergar/Mundryd Jones\|Mundryd Jones]].

## Fun Facts
- His mannerisms, even his accent, are completely different from other Fabergan dwarves.
- Purple is his least favorite color.
