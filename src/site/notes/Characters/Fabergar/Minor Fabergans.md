**Aggrup Jefferson**  
An excitable dwarf, he is a [[Characters/Fabergar/Mundryd Jones\|Mundryd]] supporter. 25 years old. He has a lot of fun and really gets into the new direction for Fabergar. When Mundryd starts coming up with new city planning ideas and [[Characters/Fabergar/Dale Diesel\|Dale]] tries to talk back, sometimes Aggrup is like, "Well I for one think this will be a fantastic idea! What could go wrong?" He is picking up on Mundryd's slang, but he doesn't always understand what it means.

**Wudalm**
She is an adult dwarf that works as a cashier at McJones. She witnessed [[Characters/Fabergar/Mundryd Jones\|Mundryd]] break some tableware on purpose instead of returning it to McJones.

**Tatey**
She is a teenage human who enjoys the \#1 combo meal and some kind of berry juice at McJones. [[Characters/Fabergar/Mundryd Jones\|Mundryd]] may or may not have made her cry when he stole her combo meal.
